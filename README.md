# 3DAutomaticSegmentationTFM
This repository contains the code of an evolutionary algorithm to optimize the parameters of three dimensional segmentation of biological images using Limeseg 
as segmentation algorithm (https://github.com/NicoKiaru/LimeSeg). To execute the algorithm you need an image sequence stack, the regions of interest of the cells and
an empty folder called results to save the segmentations and data from the algorithm. After that you only have to wait until the algorithm converges to the best solution.
